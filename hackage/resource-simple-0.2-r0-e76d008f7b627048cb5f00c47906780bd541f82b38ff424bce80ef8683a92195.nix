      description = "This is a simplified, standalone version of the @ResourceT@ transformer that\nwas originally developed as part of the @conduit@ package. That version of\n@ResourceT@ was supported by a complicated hierarchy of type classes, the\nmain purpose of which was to enable the usage of @ResourceT@ on top of the\n@ST@ monad. However, this doesn't really make much sense conceptually, and\nthe reason it was done is because conduits are very closely tied to\n@ResourceT@, and an instance for @ST@ would enable the usage of @ResourceT@\nin pure code.\n\nThis package completely does away with the supporting type class hierarchy,\nand as such, this version of @ResourceT@ can only be used with @IO@ or\n@IO@-like monads.\n\nThis package is motivated by a belief that the iteratee problem and the\nresource finalization problem are orthogonal. This package is ideal for\nusage with the @pipes@ library.";
