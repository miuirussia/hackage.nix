      description = "Gibbon is an experimental compiler that transforms\nhigh-level functional programs to operate on serialized\ndata.\n\nTypically, programs that process tree-like data\nrepresent trees using pointer-based data structures in\nmemory (one heap object per-leaf and per-node) because such\na layout is convenient to manipulate in a high-level\nprogramming language. This is also generally distinct from\nthe representation of the data in serialized form on disk,\nwhich means that a program must perform some sort or\nmarshaling when working with serialized data.\nGibbon unifies the in-memory and serialized formats,\ntransforming recursive functions to operate directly on\nserialized data.\n\nAdditionally, while the pointer-based structure is efficient\nfor random access and shape-changing modifications,\nit can be inefficient for traversals that process most or\nall of a tree in bulk. The Gibbon project aims to explore\noptimizations of recursive tree transforms by changing how\ntrees are stored in memory.";
