This is\na micro-optimization, so think hard about whether or not this\nwill improve performance in a particular situation. A different\nway to accomplish a similar goal is to forbid empty text and then\nuse the empty text value as a placeholder that signifies `Nothing`.\nThis alternative may or may not be an option depending on whether\nor not the empty string is valid in your problem domain.";
