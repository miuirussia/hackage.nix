      description = "This library provides a function to generate a special combinator from any data type (GADTs are not currently supported).\nThis was inspired by the recursion-schemes library where they have a function to automagically generate a base functor. Although, this new base functor data type has custom constructors and to define the *-morphism algebras turns into boring pattern matching.\nSo, this library provides a function called `makeCombinator` that produces a\nnice combinator to deal with data types as they were defined in terms of Pairs\n( (,) ) and Sums (`Either`). With this nice combinator we are able to view a\ndata type as its equivalent categorical isomorphism and manipulate it with an\ninterface similar as the `either` function provided from `base`.";
