This version is compatible\nwith MPFR 2.4.* and later and will not work with previous releases\nof the MPFR library.\n\n/Since MPFR uses GMP, this library features infrequent but serious errors/\n/with a ghc that has been compiled with the default integer-gmp./\n/When using ghc, it is recommended to use one compiled with a modified integer-gmp,/\n/as described at http://code.google.com/p/hmpfr/wiki/GHCWithRenamedGMP, or/\n/with integer-simple, as described at http://code.google.com/p/hmpfr/wiki/GHCWithoutGMP./\n/There is a hope that at some point future versions of ghc will not need any modification for/\n/hmpfr to work with them correctly./\n\nThe library includes both a pure and a mutable interface.\nThe mutable interface should have a lot less overhead\nthan the pure one.\n\nSome simple examples of usage can be found in demo/Demo.hs.";
