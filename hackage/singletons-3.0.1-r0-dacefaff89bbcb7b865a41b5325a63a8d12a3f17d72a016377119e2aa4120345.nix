      description = "@singletons@ contains the basic types and definitions needed to support\ndependently typed programming techniques in Haskell. This library was\noriginally presented in /Dependently Typed Programming with Singletons/,\npublished at the Haskell Symposium, 2012.\n(<https://cs.brynmawr.edu/~rae/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf>)\n\n@singletons@ is intended to be a small, foundational library on which other\nprojects can build. As such, @singletons@ has a minimal dependency\nfootprint and supports GHCs dating back to GHC 8.0. For more information,\nconsult the @singletons@\n@<https://github.com/goldfirere/singletons/blob/master/README.md README>@.\n\nYou may also be interested in the following related libraries:\n\n* The @singletons-th@ library defines Template Haskell functionality that\nallows /promotion/ of term-level functions to type-level equivalents and\n/singling/ functions to dependently typed equivalents.\n\n* The @singletons-base@ library uses @singletons-th@ to define promoted and\nsingled functions from the @base@ library, including the \"Prelude\".";
