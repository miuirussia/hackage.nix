It allows you to write temporal unit tests, check\nthem, QuickCheck them, run FRP programs with a fine-tuned debugger, obtain\ninformation to replicate tests, and follow and control the execution of a\nYampa program from an interactive GUI.\n\nThis library provides a replacement function for Yampa's standard simulation\nfunction (@reactimate@), that enables recording input into a file and reading\ninput from a file.";
