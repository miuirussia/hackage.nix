This package uses a file based database available at IP2Location.com. This database simply contains IP blocks as keys, and other information such as country, region, city, latitude, longitude, ZIP code, time zone, ISP, domain name, connection type, IDD code, area code, weather station code, weather station name, mcc, mnc, mobile brand, elevation, usage type, address type and IAB category as values.
