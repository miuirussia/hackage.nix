Tagless-Final typed DSL — basically just a clever use of type classes and instances)\ncan be augmented with an extension type (repr (a -> k) k)\nextending a function to the right — while forming a category.\nWhich makes term-level combinators able to add arguments to a function\nwithin the type they will be instantiated to (repr),\nsuch that this library's combinators\n(that you can extend by just writing a new type class)\ncan be used to write an API instantiable as:\na function asking arguments to generate a client's request,\nor a function asking handlers to generate a server's response,\nor some documentation type, or any other type\nfor which you can write the type class instances\nrequired by the API combinators you use.";
