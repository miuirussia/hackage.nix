The\nlibrary <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai dunai> provides a default\nimplementation.\n\nBearriver (a tributary to the Yampa river) provides the same API as Yampa,\nbut implemented using dunai underneath. The goal is to facilitate\nunderstanding what's different about Yampa, and other FRP and Reactive\nProgramming libraries, by creating wrappers around dunai defined precisely by\nthose differences.\n\nBecause dunai is particularly fast, especially with optimizations enabled,\nthis implementation is faster than traditional Yampa for medium-sized and\nlarge applications.";
