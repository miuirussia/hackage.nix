      description = "Goals:\n\n- reducing the complexity for the programmer of applications,\n\n- functions with identical semantics independent of representation,\n\n- all functions are total (or become so using Maybe or Either),\n\n- compatible error reporting for all packages,\n\n- avoid name clashes with other packages and assume the regular prelude,\n\n- performance is NOT a goal - once the program logic is confirmed and tested, performance improvements can be achieved based on observations\n\nThe packages included here deal with\n\n- a generally usable zero (null) value and other simplistic\nalgebras,\n\n- handling of text independent of represenations and principled conversion between representations,\n\n- a minimal error reporting as text error messages,\n\n- bringing together functions to handle time,\n\n- uniform functions to handle files and filepaths (`Filepath` and `Path`).\n\nPlease see the README on GitHub at <https://github.com/andrewufrank/uniformBase/readme>";
